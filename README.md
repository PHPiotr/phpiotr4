### What is this for?
This is an exercise app which calculates and aggregates averages and totals of my costs related to flights, buses, trains, hostels bookings.

### Why I develop this?
In order to do something useful (at least for myself) and - at the same time - learn as much as possible,
so that maybe someone will give me a chance eventually.

### How to use this?
Go to registration page (demo on Heroku) and create an account for yourself.
You will receive an activation link on your email address.
If you are a frequent flyer, then this app might be helpful
in calculating/averaging your bookings' expenses.
